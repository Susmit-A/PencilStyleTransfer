# Pencil Style Transfer

This is a personal project to experiment with [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593).

It remakes an image as if it were hand-drawn using a pencil.

To test it out, use the following command:

```
$ python3 deployment.py <image_file>
```

Requirements:

- Tensorflow 1.14 (< 2.0 and supporting eager execution)

- OpenCV

Results can be seen inside the `results` folder
